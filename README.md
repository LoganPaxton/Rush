# Rush
Rush is a new project I've started to work on. Rush is made to steal credentials. Currently, Rush is in it's beta stage, so expect bugs.

## Documentation
### Download
Before you download just note this will only work on Linux systems (Ex. Kali, Unbutu, Debain)
To download, run this command `git clone https://github.com/LoganPaxton/Rush`
Now, you've done it! You downloaded Rush!
### Setup
To setup Rush, make sure you've already downloaded it. Once you've done that, run `cd Rush` Once you do that, you have to run 2 more commands to get it all setup!
First, run `chmod +x setup.sh` This makes it so you can run the "setup.sh" file. Finally, run `./setup.sh` There you go, you have Rush all setup
### Using Rush
To use Rush, run `rush help` to see commands, and what they do. To start a webserver and start taking the emails and passwords, run `rush start` This will start a webserver on http://localhost:8080 Then, send the link in an email. **NOTE, it won't work externally at the moment, I am working on a fix!**
